            <p><b>Using our Web Application</b><br><br>Welcome to our web application that aims to increase the proffiency rate of students who are enrolled in EE110! As of right now, 2 modules are available for students to practice, which include Karnaugh Maps and Numeric Conversions. There are a couple things you should take note of before starting each module.<br><br><ul><li>Module 1: Karnaugh Maps. When identifying KMaps with Don't Cares (Xs), make sure your Xs are capitalized or else it'll be wrong.</li>
            
            <br><br><br><li>Module 1: Karnaugh Maps. When grouping, check groupings that contain only 1s in them first ( Check horizontally, vertically, then for wraps in that order ) and then check groupings that contain Xs in them ( If neccessary, check horizontally, vertically, then for wraps in that order ).</li><br><br><br><br>
            
            <li>Practice Mode is now available for both modes.</li><br><br>
            
            <li>Minor errors may occur. We are currently fixing and adding on to our project.</li></ul><br><br>
