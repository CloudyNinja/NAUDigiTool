To test a file you need a function ( Ex. sum.js ), along with a test file for that function ( Ex. sum.test.js )

Once test is configured, go to terminal and run: 1. npm test

To see a more detailed analysis go to package.json and switch 'jest' to 'jest --coverage'

All of the grouping problems were testing through the console and manual checks since each function was void.
