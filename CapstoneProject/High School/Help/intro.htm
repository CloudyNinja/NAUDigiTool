<h3>Inroduction &amp; Definitions</h3>
The purpose of the KMapplet is to give a basic introduction of Digital 
Logic and expose students to a small segment of Electrical Engineering before college. 
The applet is a simplified version of the applet used by Northern Arizona University's 
Digital Logic class to practice simplifying Boolean Equations using the Karnaugh Map method. 
By introducing this applet into High Schools we hope to promote some basic understanding 
of Digital Logic and promote interest in the field of Electrical 
Engineering.

<font size="4"><b>Basic Definitions</b></font>

<p>The following are some basic terms that need to be understood to work with the KMapplet.</p>

<p>First of all, it is important to understand that Digital Logic is done in the <b>Binary</b> 
number system. <b>Binary</b> is a base 2 number system, which consists of numbers that are 
composed of a series of zeros and ones. Since zeros and ones can be easily represented by 
two voltage levels on an electronic device (high voltage and low voltage), the binary number 
system is widely used in digital computing.</p>

<p>In Digital Logic <b>Boolean Algebra</b> is used to represent and simplify circuits. 
<b>Boolean Algebra</b> is a branch of mathematics concerned with logic analysis and 
manipulation of binary numbers. Boolean Algebra uses Boolean variables and Boolean operators.</p>

<p><b>Boolean Variables</b> are variables used in Boolean equations that represent only the 
values 1 or 0.  The 1’s and 0’s are often thought of as true and false or on and off.  1’s 
are most commonly represented by high voltage and 0’s by low voltage but that is not always 
the case.</p>

<p><b>Boolean Operators:</b> You will see plus symbol “+” and multiplication symbols “*, 
( ), or simply AB = A*B”. These are the two main operations that can be done in 
Boolean algebra.  The + stands for OR, and the multiplication stands for AND.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>AND </b>is true when all variables involved are true, and is false otherwise.</li>
	<li><b>OR </b>is true when at least one variable involved is true, and false only when all variables are false.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Boolean Equations</b> are the equations that represent a circuit. Like any other math 
equation it consists of variables and operators.<br>
<font size="2"><b>The Equations have been disabled in the High School version</b></font>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>SOP</b> (Sum of Products) In this situation the equation is in the form of AB+BC.</li>
	<li><b>POS</b> (Product of Sums) In this situation the equation is in the form of (A+B)(B+C)</li>
</ul>
